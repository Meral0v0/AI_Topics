Near-Earth Objects (NEOs) pose potential hazards to our planet, making their accurate classification and risk assessment critical for planetary defense and space exploration. 
This study leverages NASA’s extensive NEO dataset, encompassing over 16,000 entries with detailed attributes such as diameter, velocity, and miss distance. 
We evaluate four advanced machine learning algorithms—Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP), XGBoost, Logistic Regression, and Naive Bayes—to classify NEOs as potentially hazardous or non-hazardous. 
The models' performance was assessed using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score metrics. Results indicate that XGBoost achieved the highest accuracy (99%), demonstrating superior precision and recall, particularly in handling class imbalances. 
Logistic Regression also performed well, achieving a 90% accuracy with balanced classification. 
In contrast, MLP and Naive Bayes faced challenges, especially with class imbalance and feature dependencies.
